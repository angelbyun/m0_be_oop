# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It was frustrating, rewarding, and exciting all at once. The amount of times I needed to walk away from my computer and take a deep breath because I felt like I was losing my mind, but once I would come back and figure out what was causing the error, that satisfying moment of seeing your code run through the Console on Replit the way it should. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I am the most focused in the morning and early afternoon. Towards the end of the day, I can start to feel my mind wander and the ADD kick in. However, I have learned that putting my phone on silent, having a silent house, and making sure I have had food, water, and time to breathe, will allow me to be more productive even towards the end of the day.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I was able to get through this week simply because of my peers. They have been extremely helpful in helping me in lessons, but just keeping me sane. It is nice to have peers that have a sense of humor and we can chat in between exercises so that we can feel human again. The next thing I want to make a priority is completely changing my workspace. I have ordered a standing desk which I know will help me throughout the day so I wouldn't have to sit so much (which is killing my back).
